The original library was made by enternoescape.as below.

To download from github (https://github.com/enternoescape/Arduino-IRremote-Due), click on the "Downloads" link in the upper right, click "Download as zip", and get a zip file.  Unzip it and rename the directory enternoescape-Arduino-IRremote-Due-nnn to IRremote

To install, move the downloaded IRremote directory to:
arduino-1.x/libraries/IRremote
where arduino-1.x is your Arduino installation directory

The functionalities added by me :

1. The library now supports 2 receivers simultaneously.

For details on the library see the Wiki on github or the blog post http://arcfn.com/2009/08/multi-protocol-infrared-remote-library.html
